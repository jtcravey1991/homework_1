Homework 1  Jacob Cravey

This project involved us going over existing html and css code that, while fully functional, included no semantic elements and needed
several other optimizations. Some of these included: repeat classes that could be condensed down to a single class and reused, the
addition of semantic elements instead of using div for everything, a faulty navigational link, adding descriptive alt parameters to
img elements, and some simple coding errors.
